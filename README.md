# Instructions for Compiling and Running Part1.java and Part2.java

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use a package manager like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/).

## Compilation

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files (`Part1.java` and `Part2.java`).

### Part1.java

```bash
javac Part1.java
```

### Part2.java

```bash
javac Part2.java
```

## Running the Programs

### Part1.java

```bash
java Part1
```

The program will read the contents of the `input.txt` file and output the elf with the most calories.

### Part2.java

```bash
java Part2
```

Replace `Part2` with the correct class name. The program will execute its functionality based on the code within `Part2.java`.

## Notes

- Make sure the `input.txt` file is present in the same directory as the compiled Java files.
- Ensure that the input file contains the necessary data for the programs to execute correctly.
